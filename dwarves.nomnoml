# For this assignment, you will model a Board Game using UML Class diagrams, in order to best understand how all the elements are interconnected.
# It does not need to be 100% complete or perfect. A reflection report will also be part of the submission (no max or min number of words), where you
# discuss which aspect of implementing a board gave you find most interesting, and which most challenging.

# Submission: Zip file name Last Name_First Name_ Compulsory 1

#PDF or PNG (high quality) with UML class diagrams.
#PDF with self reflection (most interesting AND most challenging aspect to implement).

#ideas: Make a stack for the menu etc. Look at the book data structures for games. Be inspired and have fun!
# Have AI stuff in there! Pathfinding! Min-Max algorithm. Commands! Design patterns!

#[Dwarves: Gem Chase is a board game for two to six players.
#The game takes place on a mountain where greedy dwarves fight to become the wealthiest dwarf of them all.
#The mountain is scattered with gemstones of great value, and a golden dragon egg at the very tip of the mountain.
#All gemstones are placed on the map and picked up during the game.
#
#At the beginning of the game, each player chooses a color and a corner to be their home base and places their coloured player pieces (dwarves) there.
#They will also receive a secret mission card. Players take turns moving their game pieces and collecting gemstones.
#If the dragon egg is collected and brought back to a dwarf's home base, the game ends.
#To pick up the dragon egg, a player must first possess a minimum of three gemstones.
#If all the gemstones are picked up, the game ends. The game also ends if a player completes their secret mission.
#
#The winner is the player with the most gemstones when the game ends, alternatively the player who has completed their secret mission.
#
#END STATES: 
#* Dragon egg has been taken to a home base.
#* A player completes their secret mission.
#* All gems gone from the game board.
#
#VICTORY: 
#* The winner is the player with the most gems in their home base.
#* Alternatively, the player who finishes their mission is the winner.
#* Dragon egg is worth 10 gems if at a player’s home base.
#
#For 2 - 6 players.
#Playtime: 25 min.
#
#Get Started (In this version of the game, the board has already been set up for you)
#
#* Place the gems on the game board where there are gem icons.
#* Put the dragon egg in the middle of the board.
#
#Choose a colour!
#* Take your dwarf pieces and put them in your colour's start ship.
#(In this version, simply choose a colour, you can change your colour by pressing the icon at the top right of the screen)
#
#Let's go.
#Decide on who starts by rolling a die! Player with the highest number starts.
#
#The game goes in turns clockwise.
#
#Before you begin ...
#* Each player takes a mission card from the mission card pile. (Remember to shuffle the cards! Keep your mission secret)
#
#Start your turn
#* You receive 4 action points at the beginning of each turn.
#* To use a card on your hand costs 1 action point.
#* To move one of your dwarves costs 1 action point per space.
#* When moving out of your ship, the first space is marked ① .
#* You can only move your dwarves in the direction marked on the map.
#* Your dwarves may share the same space on the game board.
#* If you move to a place with gems, you can use 1 action point per gem to pick them up! Put the gems into your ship.
#* When one of your dwarves reaches a yellow area you can pick up a chance card FOR FREE! (Only one chance card can be picked up per turn)
#* Only players with three gems (of any colour) in their ship can pick up the dragon egg - pick up and carry the dragon egg with
#a dwarf by moving a dwarf over to it and placing the egg onto the dwarves' open arms. Picking up the dragon egg does not cost any action points.
#While carrying the dragon egg, movement is limited to two spaces for that dwarf (Remember, you can still move other dwarf pieces and use cards
#for the remaining action points) The game ends when a player has taken the dragon egg all the way to their Home Base, the egg is worth 10 gems 
#but the winner might still be the one with the most gems.
#* A dwarf landing on another team's dwarf sends the enemy dwarf back to their home base and you can steal one gem for 0 action points from the other player.
#* By landing on a dwarf holding the dragon egg, you can choose to simply send the enemy dwarf back to their home base, or to also take the dragon egg
#with you, carried by your dwarf, if you have at least 3 gems (of any colour) in your gem store.
#
#Always remember:
#* The dragon egg is worth 10 gems. It has to be in your home base to count towards your score.
#* A dwarf carrying the dragon egg can only move two spaces per turn.
#* You receive a chance card FOR FREE by passing yellow spaces with a dwarf. Only one per turn."]
